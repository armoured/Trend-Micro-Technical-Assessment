## Send Requests Through The Api Gateway

When you deployed the users service, serverless would have listed the api gateway endpoints
that were deployed.

They will look something like

`
  POST - https://pm7uuzazic.execute-api.ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/dev/users
  GET - https://pm7uuzazic.execute-api.ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/dev/users
`

Using a tool like postman https://www.postman.com/downloads/ feel free to send GET and POST requests to the endpoints you got. 

Here is some sample data you can use for the POST request. Make sure to include this in the body in JSON format.

{
    "firstname": "Mitchell",
    "lastname": "Shelton",
    "email": "mitchellshelton97@gmail.com",
    "username": "mitty",
    "credentials": "password"
}
